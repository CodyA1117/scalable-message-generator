#Scalable Message Generator

This perticular program is a simple quote generator that can be scaled to many other things such as random planets, animals, and or jokes.  Really the options are endless.
The idea here was to code a simple program that utilizes Git version control, javaScript and CSS responsive design.  To scale this program we can create a persistent login,
a database to store our favorite quotes, linking an API, and user account managment. We could also have tabs for the different generators.

#Tools
I used visual studio code, html, css, and javascript to complete the program.

#How are thins stored?
Storage of the quotes are a simple javascript array of about 50 different quotes.  To expand this we could connect and API, and also create a login for users for more personalization.

#How to use the program?
Simply click the Generate Quote button.
